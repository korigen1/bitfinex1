Response

The vendor confirmed that both lines of the 150-CR-104-XX-01/02 could be released to
ATM. However, contractor decided to connect the vent line of the Drain Pot for ROD
Packing (150-CR-104-XX-02) to the LPF by supplying manual valve (LO). Therefore, the
vent line of 150-CR-002-XX-01 will be connected to ATM, and the vent line of 150-CR-
002-XX-02 will be connected to LPF by supplying manual valve (LO).

Action

Provide check valve on cooling water supply line for Make-up H2 1st Stage Water Cooler

Response

In the case of the water cooler tube rupture, it is meaningless to install the check vavle of
the supply line because the fluid will flow toward the return line according to the pressure
profile. Hydrogen monitoring is possible via the gas detector on the vent goose neck on
the cooling tower side and the PT on the cooling water return line. Therefore, check valve
will not be installed on the cooling water supply line.

Evaluate discharge collection of 150-PSV-0834A/0835A to Oily Water Sewer (OWS)

Response

Current scheme of PSV discharge to grade at safe location will be maintained, as this
PSV is only a thermal relief valve and expected relieving flow and frequency is quite low.
(i.e., maintenance of PSV) It should be noted that the PSV and line will be located inside
skid. It is a general practice to route thermal relief outlet inside the skid. If discharge is
separately routed outside of skid, this line will block open spaces and make maintenance
works difficult.
